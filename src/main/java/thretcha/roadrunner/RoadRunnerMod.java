//physical server - server.jar
//Logical server - (world.isRemote==false)The logical server is what runs game logic: mob spawning, weather, updating inventories, health, AI, and all other game mechanics.

//physical client - minecraft.exe
//logical client - (world.isRemote==true)The logical client is what accepts input from the player and relays it to the logical server.
//In addition, it also receives information from the logical server and makes it available graphically to the player.
// The logical client runs in the Client Thread, though often several other threads are spawned to handle things like audio and chunk render batching.

//communication between logical sides only using network packets
